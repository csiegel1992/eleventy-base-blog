# About Me

I have undergone my coding Journey at the beginning of 2023 and aim to land my first role by the end of the year. Along side teaching myself the basics of Javascript, HTML, CSS and Python, I have undertaken the Web Design and Development course with The Coders Guild and am looking to get into the industry as a Developer and use my people management and business focused skills to add more to the roles I am afforded.

Please see my CV below.
