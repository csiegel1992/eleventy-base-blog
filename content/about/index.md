# About Me

I'm Chris, an experienced Manager with a demonstrated history of working in the hospitality, print & music industry. Strong professional with 10+ years experience focussed on growing businesses, sales, teams & structure. Skilled in People Management, Business Management, Production Management, Sales, Music Production, and Event Management.
I believe to be successful you need 20% of knowledge of the task at hand and 80% is how you interact with and work with people helping you along the way.

I have undergone my coding Journey at the beginning of 2023 and aim to land my first role by the end of the year. Along side teaching myself the basics of Javascript, HTML, CSS and Python, I have undertaken the Web Design and Development course with The Coders Guild and am looking to get into the industry as a Developer and use my people management and business focused skills to add more to the roles I am afforded.
