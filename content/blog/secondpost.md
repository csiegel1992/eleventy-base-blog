In this session, we explored the concept of functions, how to declare and use them, and dive into variable scope and control flow. These are fundamental concepts that allow me to write efficient and reusable code.

Functions: Reusable Blocks of Code
A function is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task. It allows developers to organize their code into smaller, manageable chunks and easily reuse them when needed. To declare a function, you provide it with a name and enclose the code within curly braces.

Invoking Functions: Putting Code into Action
To use a function, you invoke it by typing its name followed by parentheses. This tells the browser to run the code inside the function.

Arguments and Parameters: Enriching Functionality
Functions can also accept inputs, known as arguments or parameters. These inputs provide flexibility and allow functions to work with different values.

Returning Values: The Power of Output
Functions can also provide a return value that can be used later in the code. The return statement is used to specify the value that the function should output.

Variable Scope: Understanding Accessibility
The scope of a variable determines where its value is accessible in the program. JavaScript distinguishes between global scope and local scope.

Global Scope: Variables declared outside of any function have a global scope and can be accessed from anywhere in the code.
Local Scope: Variables declared within a function have a local scope and are only accessible within that specific function.

Control Flow: Making Decisions with Conditional Statements
JavaScript provides conditional statements that allow you to control the flow of your code based on specific conditions. One commonly used conditional statement is the if statement.

Comparison Operators: Evaluating Conditions
Comparison operators are used within conditional statements to compare values and determine their relationship. These operators help in decision-making and control the execution of code blocks.

Boolean Values and Variables: The Essence of Logic
In JavaScript, Boolean values represent logical values of true or false. They are used to control the flow of the program and make decisions based on certain conditions.

To demonstrate the above concepts we completed the following tasks;

Task 1

Write a function that outputs a sentence. Then invoke that function later in your code.

Task 2

Write a simple program to combine a first name and a last name inside a function. Then update the function to accept a first and last name as arguments.

Task 3

Add a return statement to your 'name' function. Use that function to set the value of a variable.

Task 4

a) Make a variable called "temperature". Write some code that tells you to put on a coat if it is below 50 degrees

b) Extend the Program to show the following:


If it's less than 50 degrees, wear a coat.

If it's less than 30 degrees, wear a coat and a hat.

If it's less than 0 degrees, stay inside.

Otherwise, just pants and vest is fine.
