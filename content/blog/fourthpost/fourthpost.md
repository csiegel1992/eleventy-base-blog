In this session we covered how pseudocode is a simplified version of programming code written in plain English. 

#### Understanding Pseudocode:
Pseudocode is not an actual programming language but rather a descriptive representation of code logic. It allows developers to focus on problem-solving without getting bogged down in specific syntax, standards, languages, or frameworks. By using pseudocode, developers can concentrate on the essence of the problem and communicate their thoughts and ideas effectively.

#### Advantages of Pseudocode:
1. Focus on the Problem: Pseudocode helps developers break down complex problems into manageable steps, enabling them to focus on finding effective solutions.
2. Communication and Discussion: Pseudocode serves as a common language that facilitates collaboration and discussion among developers. It allows teams to share ideas, review algorithms, and provide feedback.
3. Anticipate Problems/Issues/Questions: Pseudocode encourages developers to think ahead and consider potential challenges or questions that may arise during the implementation phase. It promotes proactive problem-solving.
4. Efficient Prototyping: Pseudocode enables developers to prototype solutions quickly and iteratively. It allows for rapid experimentation and validation of ideas before diving into detailed coding.

#### Pseudocode in Interviews and Tests:
Pseudocode plays a valuable role in technical interviews and coding tests. It allows developers to demonstrate their problem-solving skills, logic, and reasoning abilities, even if they are not familiar with the preferred syntax, standards, languages, or frameworks used by the interviewer. Pseudocode can serve as a fallback option in situations where time is limited, enabling candidates to deliver a partial solution while showcasing their planning and approach.

#### How to Write Pseudocode:
To write effective pseudocode there are no set rules but, consider the following guidelines:
1. CAPITALIZE key commands: Use capital letters to highlight essential commands or actions, such as IF, WHILE, or FOR loops.
2. One Statement per Line: Write each statement on a separate line to enhance readability and clarity.
3. Indentation and Spacing: Use indentation to indicate the structure of your pseudocode and make it easier to follow. Use appropriate spacing to improve legibility.
4. Be Specific: Clearly define the steps and actions required to solve the problem, using precise and concise language.
5. Keep it Simple: Use non-technical language to ensure that your pseudocode is accessible to a broader audience, including non-programmers.

#### Task 

Fix start

Create a function called fixStart. It should take a single argument, a string, and return a version where all occurrences of its first character have been replaced with ‘*****’, except for the first character itself. You can assume that the string is at least one character long. For example:


fixStart('babble'): 'ba**le'

fixStart('turtle'): 'tur*le'
