JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a versatile programming language that plays a crucial role in modern web development. It empowers developers to add dynamic and interactive features to websites, enhancing user experiences. In this blog post, we will cover the fundamentals of JavaScript we learned in the session, its applications, and how it can be applied to websites. We will cover output methods, variables, data types, operators, and go over tasks that helped me strengthen my understanding.

What is JavaScript?
JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language primarily used for client-side web development. It was created to make websites more interactive and responsive by allowing developers to manipulate web page elements, handle events, and communicate with servers.

What can JavaScript do?
JavaScript is incredibly versatile and offers a wide range of functionalities. We covered the following in our session:

Event Handling: JavaScript enables developers to respond to user actions, such as button clicks, form submissions, or mouse movements. This interactivity enhances the user experience by providing real-time feedback.

How to apply JavaScript to a Website:
To apply JavaScript to a website, you have a few options:

1. Inline JavaScript: You can include JavaScript code directly within an HTML file using the `<script>` tag. This method is suitable for small scripts or quick experiments but is not recommended for larger projects.

2. External JavaScript File: It's considered best practice to create a separate JavaScript file with a .js extension and link it to your HTML file using the `<script>` tag. This approach promotes code reusability and maintainability.

Output Methods:
JavaScript provides several ways to display output to users or developers:

1. `console.log()`: This method is commonly used for debugging purposes. It outputs messages to the browser's console, which can be accessed using browser developer tools.

2. `alert()`: The `alert()` function displays a pop-up window with a specified message. It is useful for displaying simple notifications or prompting user interactions.

3. `document.write()`: This method writes content directly into the HTML document. However, it is rarely used in modern web development due to potential security risks and its limited functionality.

Variables, Data Types, and Operators:
JavaScript supports various data types, including:

1. Numbers: Representing numeric values, such as integers or floating-point numbers.
2. Strings: Representing textual data, enclosed within single quotes ('') or double quotes ("").
3. Booleans: Representing logical values, either `true` or `false`.
4. Arrays: Representing ordered lists of values enclosed in square brackets ([]).
5. Objects: Representing complex data structures containing key-value pairs, enclosed in curly braces ({}) and accessed using dot notation or bracket notation.

JavaScript also provides a wide range of operators for performing mathematical, logical, and comparison operations.

Tasks:
Here are some tasks we completeted to practice JavaScript:

1. Create a JavaScript file and link it to an HTML document.
2. Use `console.log()` to output a message to the browser console.
3. Use `alert()` to display a pop-up notification to the user.
4. Declare variables
