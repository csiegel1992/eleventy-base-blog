Loops, arrays, and objects are essential concepts that allow developers to work with data more efficiently and effectively. In this sesssion post we looked into while loops, arrays, and objects in JavaScript. We were taught how these concepts can be used to manipulate and iterate through data.

#### While Loops:
While loops are a fundamental construct in programming that repeatedly executes a block of code until a specific condition is met. By checking the condition at the beginning of each iteration, while loops provide flexibility in controlling program flow. However, it's crucial to ensure that the condition eventually becomes false; otherwise, an infinite loop can occur. Remember, in while loops, you must make sure something changes to prevent them from running indefinitely.

#### For Loops:
Similar to while loops, for loops allow you to repeat a block of code. However, for loops introduce a counter that is declared in the loop statement. This counter allows tracking the number of iterations, making it easier to work with arrays and perform specific tasks a set number of times. By specifying the starting point, ending condition, and increment or decrement value, for loops offer control over repetitive operations.

#### Loops and Logic:
Loops become even more powerful when combined with conditional statements and logical operators. Within the loop's block of code, you can incorporate if statements, comparisons, and logical operators to perform different actions based on specific conditions. This flexibility allows you to create dynamic and adaptable code that responds to varying scenarios.

#### Break Statement:
To exit a loop prematurely, you can use the break statement. When encountered within a loop, the break statement immediately terminates the loop, regardless of the loop condition. This feature proves handy when you need to stop the loop execution based on certain criteria or conditions.

#### Arrays:
Arrays serve as ordered lists of values, enabling you to store multiple data elements within a single variable. JavaScript arrays can accommodate various data types, including strings, numbers, and objects. By utilizing arrays, you can organize and access related data more efficiently. It's important to note that JavaScript arrays are zero-indexed, meaning the first element has an index of 0.

#### Array Length and Accessing Items:
The length property of an array provides the count of elements contained within it. By accessing items in an array using bracket notation and specifying the index (position) of the desired item, you can retrieve or modify its value. Remember to adhere to zero-indexing when referring to specific elements within the array.

#### Changing and Expanding Arrays:
JavaScript arrays are mutable, allowing you to change their elements using bracket notation. You can modify an item by assigning a new value to its corresponding index. Additionally, arrays can dynamically expand in size using the push method, which adds a new element to the end of the array. This flexibility enables you to adapt your data structure as your program progresses.

#### Const Arrays:
When using the const keyword to declare an array, you can still modify its elements, add new ones, or remove existing ones. However, the const declaration ensures that the variable itself cannot be reassigned to a different array or data type. This feature promotes code clarity and prevents accidental variable reassignment.

#### Iterating Through Arrays:
To perform actions on each element of an array, you can use various looping techniques. One common approach is using a for...of loop, which allows you to iterate through every item in the array without explicitly managing a counter. Alternatively, you can use a for loop with a counter to achieve the same result. Both methods offer flexibility, and your choice depends on the specific requirements of your program.

#### Objects:
Objects in JavaScript provide a means to store collections of properties. They allow you to group related data together, making it easier to organize and access information. Objects can contain various data types, including strings, numbers, arrays, and even other objects. Accessing and modifying object properties can be achieved using dot notation or bracket notation, similar to working with arrays.

#### Object Functions/Methods:
Objects can hold not only properties but also functions, which are commonly referred to as methods. Methods encapsulate reusable blocks of code that can be called on an object using dot notation. This approach promotes code modularity and allows you to organize related functionality within your objects effectively.

#### Task:

##### Task 1

Write a loop that outputs the 7 times table,

from 7 x 1 = 7 to 7 x 12 = 84

##### Task 2

Create an array of your favourite foods.

Print some of them to the screen

##### Task 3

Use a for loop to print a list of all your favourite foods

##### Task 4

Create an object to hold information on your favourite recipe. Then display the properties on screen.

Bonus Points: Create a loop to list all the ingredients and directions.

##### Task 5

Add a function called letsCook

Have it say: "I'm hungry! Let's cook..." with the name of your recipe title.

Call your new method.
